SOSreport API changed drastically from v2.2 to v2.3 and later.

tower-sos2.py is for v2.2 (shipped with EL6), and tower-sos3.py is for
v2.3 and greater, shipped with Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, and EL7.

On EL6, the plugin goes in /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sos/plugins/

On EL7, /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sos/plugins/

On Ubuntu, /usr/share/sosreport/sos/plugins/

To test, run "sosreport" and follow the directions.
