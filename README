SOSreport API changed drastically from v2.2 to v2.3 and later.

tower-sos2.py is for v2.2 (EL6), and tower-sos3.py is for v2.3 and greater,
shipped with Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04.

On EL6, the plugin goes in /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sos/plugins/

On Ubuntu, the plugin goes in /usr/share/sosreport/sos/plugins/

To test, run "sosreport" and follow the directions.
